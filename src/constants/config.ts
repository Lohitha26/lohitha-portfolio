I specialize in creating API-first solutions, integrating headless CMS platforms like DatoCMS, and deploying seamlessly to the edge with platforms like Vercel. Beyond writing clean, maintainable code, Iâ€™ve taken ownership of leading UI architecture, driving product decisions, and implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker. Iâ€™ve also mentored junior developers, reviewed code, and guided teams toward better engineering practicesâ€”strengthening delivery velocity and collaboration. I thrive in fast-paced environments where quality, scalability, and user experience are equally valued. My goal is always to build performant apps that are optimized for users and easy for teams to maintain and scale.
